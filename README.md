The mechanical design phase for the MoonRat II enclosure is officially complete. All recent updates, including finalizing mounting holes, component spacing, and structural parameters, have been committed. The finalized design files are now being test printed. 
Pending a successful print, the enclosure will be ready for assembly.

# Status, August 2025  
**Latest Progress -> Weâ€™re finalizing all updated FreeCAD 3D models by next week!** This includes:  
- New enclosure design - improved insulation/portability 
- Redesigned controller mounts - 3D-printed, better cable management
- Mechanical optimizations - easier assembly/maintenance

#### Updated Experiment.com succesful project funding round
In January 2023, 13 generous patrons funded the production of five complete MoonRatII prototypes. we updated them with the [project results](https://experiment.com/projects/tote-size-portable-incubator-for-rapid-field-work
).
#### 2024 field testing resulted in future unit changes:
- Heater board redesign with a Dallas One wire digital temperature thermometer and a 4.7 ohm pull up resistor.
- Design a universal heater board cage to secure the heater board beneath the container lid in any external enclosure.
- Adjust top button spacing in KiCad.
- Add bottom mounting holes to the enclosure.

# Status, November 2024 
A scientific research paper is tentatively scheduled for March 2025 in the HardwareX journal.

# Status, September 2024  
Prototypes of the MoonratII were field tested in two locations - the Galapagos Islands by researcher Auja Bywater and in Tanzania by Dr. Robert Read. The heater features the TMP36 low voltage temperature sensor. A HardwareX scientific research paper is slated for October 2024 publication.

# Status, April 2024  
The MoonRatII team has produced five Printed Circuit Assemblies (Control and Heater) of the Rev 1 PWB for use by the USA team and five Printed Circuit Assemblies (Control and Heater) of the Rev 2 PWB for use by  the Mexico team. Enclosure design for the Controller Assembly of Rev 3 PWB is underway TBA. 

# Status January 2024
[Dr. Robert Read](https://www.pubinv.org) and [Melanie Laporte](https://github.com/melanielaporte) presented the MoonRatII project. Watch the [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTW_BcTsaGw&t=22s). 

# Current Design Summary
In one schematic and PCB, we have developed a "Control Assembly" and a "Heater Assembly".  
- The Control Assembly will be in an enclosure detachable from the incubation chamber.  
- The Heater Assembly will mounted internal to the incubation assembly under the unit top. Current to a heating pad or pads has changed from the previously used TMP36 low voltage temperature sensor to a digital temperature sensor. 
- A rechargable battery with its recharging station will complete a MoonRatII incubator system.

# 2023 MoonRatII Design

### Fundamental Modularity: The 6-wire appliance 
The connections from the controller to the heater needs only 6 wires:
1. GND (ground, nominally voltage 0).
2. +12V PWR (the heating elements requires approximately 12V power).
3. HEAT ON (Vin).
4. +5V (for the thermometer).
5. SIG - data from the digital "one-wire" format.
6. UNK - a final wire is included for future functionality that is unknown right now.  It is connected as a redundant ground in Rev 1 and Rev 2.

These (esp. the power) should probably be rated for 2 amps, but in practice 1 amp is probably good enough.

Basic Structure of Portable Incubator (1)
</a> 

## Motivation
By building a small, portable, intelligent incubator that can maintain constant elevated temperature, a variety of biological experiments and assays can be
performed "in the field" without having access to a electric grid power.

## Origin
This is an offshoot of the [Rapid E. coli project](https://github.com/PubInv/rapid-e-coli). It is an attempt to build a better, smaller, more intelligent
portable incubator that the Armadillo, described [elsewhere](http://jhe.ewb.org.au/index.php/jhe/article/view/127) and buildable from an [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Portable-Petrifilm-Incubator-for-Inexpensive-In-Fi/).
